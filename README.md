# Udacity-Nanodegree-Project-2_NYSE
This project consists of three tasks: 1) A complete data analysis and a presentation to show findings, 
2) Development of a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement, 
and 3) create a Financial Forecasting Model using three scenarios. 

Task 1:

a. The data analysis answers the question "Which company generated the highest Total revenue in  the first year?" and is included in the slide presentation.
(The question includes at least one categorical variable (GICS Sector or GICS Sub Industry) and one quantitative variable (one of the financial metrics) and utlilized at least one of the summary statistics)
b. The slide presentation provided one visualization to help with the answer.
This visualization is a bar chart and included the insights from the measures of center and spread and one numeric summary statistic in the description.

Deliverable: Slide presentation (includes visualization)

Task 2:
A dashboard is created for a Profit and Loss Statement that calculates the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for a company selected from a drop-down list.
The drop-down list pulls historical fundamental data to create the P&L Statement.
The P&L statement included the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT values for all the years that there is historical data available for that company in the dataset.

Deliverable: Spreadsheet with tab for Dynamic P&L statement

Task 3:
A financial model is created for a company (different from Task 2) that forecasts out the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for two more years using three scenarios (Best case, Weak case and Base case).
The assumptions for revenue growth, gross margin and operating margin changes for each scenario.
The forecasting model is dynamic for the selection of the case (Weak, Base, Strong). However, the forecasting model can be static for the chosen company sticker symbol.

Deliverable: Spreadsheet with tab for Forecasting Model
